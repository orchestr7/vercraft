     * The [[currentCheckoutBranch]] refers to any "release/" branch in this context.
     *
     * We have checked out a specific commit (HEAD) from a release branch and need to calculate its version.
     * To achieve this, we must identify the first commit in the release branch and calculate the version based on that.
     *
     * Example:
     * aaa -> bbb (release/0.1.0)
     *        V
     *       xxx
     *        V
     *       yyy (?)
     *
     * To compute the version, we locate the initial commit in the release branch â€” the point where the branch diverged
     * from the main branch. Then, we calculate the distance (number of commits) between this base commit and the
     * current commit for which we are determining the version.
     *
     * In this example:
     * - Commit "bbb" represents version "0.1.0".
     * - Commit "xxx" will have version "0.1.1".
     * - Commit "yyy" will be assigned version "0.1.2".
     *
     * This scenario applies to PATCH versions. Commits like **xxx** and **yyy** are typically created to implement
     * patches or additional fixes after the release of version **0.1.0** (commit **bbb**).
