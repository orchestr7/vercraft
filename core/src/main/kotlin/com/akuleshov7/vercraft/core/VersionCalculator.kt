     * 1) incremented MINOR version of the last release version (0.1.0)
     * 2) incrementing PATCH version by the number of commits between commits bbb and yyy (in this case, 2 commits).

     * "-main" and the first 5 characters of the commit hash. So the result will be as following:
     * aaa -> bbb (release/0.1.0) -> 0.2.0-main+hash -> 0.2.1-main+hash (?)

     * The [[currentCheckoutBranch]] refers to any "release/" branch in this context.
     *
     * We have checked out a specific commit (HEAD) from a release branch and need to calculate its version.
     * To achieve this, we must identify the first commit in the release branch and calculate the version based on that.
     *
     * Example:
     * aaa -> bbb (release/0.1.0)
     *        V
     *       xxx
     *        V
     *       yyy (?)
     *
     * To compute the version, we locate the initial commit in the release branch â€” the point where the branch diverged
     * from the main branch. Then, we calculate the distance (number of commits) between this base commit and the
     * current commit for which we are determining the version.
     *
     * In this example:
     * - Commit "bbb" represents version "0.1.0".
     * - Commit "xxx" will have version "0.1.1".
     * - Commit "yyy" will be assigned version "0.1.2".
     *
     * This scenario applies to PATCH versions. Commits like **xxx** and **yyy** are typically created to implement
     * patches or additional fixes after the release of version **0.1.0** (commit **bbb**).

     * - The last segment of the branch name (substring after the final "/").
     * - The current date in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.

     * For example, if the branch is "feature/blabla" and the commit distance is 1,
